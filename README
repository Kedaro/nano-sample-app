Dockerfile.cudasamples

1) Install NVidia SDK & download all packages for the Jetson NANO. Do not flash the board from SDK manager.
2) run ./prepare.sh <path_to_sdk_downloads_dir>
3) Build Dockerfile.cudasamples
4) In the app container, start the X display server and run the prebuilt sample apps:
    $ X &
    $ ./clock
    $ ./deviceQuery
    $ ./postProcessGL
    $ ./simpleGL
    $ ./simpleTexture3D
    $ ./smokeParticles

NOTE: CUDA runtime libraries are very large, some even reaching 100-250MB. Therefore not all sample apps have been built in order to keep image size low.
To build more examples please add them to the samples section of the Dockerfile.
